Hello my name is big bear some day I will be an austronaut

I will fly to the
moon and make lots of big discoveries.

Is there Gravity there? We just don't know.

Is there biology there? Maybe, maybe there's only physics. It's hard for us to think about but that's because we don't have as big of brains as we could.

I often imagine myself stepping out of that space shuttle onto the moon. I imagine the boot prints I'll leave, the wind rushing through my hair. I think it will feel like freedom.
